# Black Forest Tools

A desktop window for [shop.blackforestautomotive.com](https://shop.blackforestautomotive.com). It is another way to open the shop tools, on Manjaro, in their own window.

The window loads the live site. The book, the lot, notes, parts, crew, invoices, and the service calendar stay on the site. Publishing the site updates this window. This project does not keep a copy of the shop, and it does not need a new API.

## Install on Manjaro

```bash
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm git
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/BlackForestPorsche/shop-desktop.git
cd ~/shop-desktop
npm install
npm run install-menu
```

If zsh asks `correct 'npm' to 'nm'?`, answer `n`. After `pacman` finishes, open a new terminal so `npm` is on your PATH.

Open **Black Forest Tools** from the application menu, or run `blackforest-tools`.

If the window opens and closes right away, the Electron binary may not have downloaded. Fix it from a terminal:

```bash
cd ~/shop-desktop
bash scripts/ensure-electron.sh
npm start
```

`~/.local/bin` needs to be on `PATH` for the command. The menu entry does not depend on that. A new login picks up the path on Manjaro. Launch errors are written to `~/.local/state/blackforest-tools/launch.log`.

To run it without installing the menu entry:

```bash
cd ~/shop-desktop
npm start
```

## What stays in sync

- Shop records come from the site as you use them, including `/_serverFn/`, `/api/google/start`, and `/api/shop-archive`.
- The first document load skips the HTTP cache, and the window asks to reload when a publish changes the site's scripts.
- **Shop → Reload and pick up site updates** (Ctrl+Shift+R) forces that immediately.
- This computer remembers the unlock, theme, and offline write queue for this window. That saved session lives in `~/.config/Black Forest Tools`. A browser on the same machine has its own. After you unlock here, you are on the same shop data.

Parts-catalog links open in the normal browser. Google sign-in stays in this window so Connect Google can finish back on the shop server.

## Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+R | Reload |
| Ctrl+Shift+R | Reload and pick up site updates |
| Alt+Left / Alt+Right | Back / forward |
| Alt+Home | Shop home |
| Ctrl+Q | Quit |
| Alt | Show the menu |

## Update the window itself

Shop publishes do not require an update of this project. Pull only when this repo changes:

```bash
git pull
npm install
```

## Windows

GitHub Actions builds a Windows installer and a portable `.exe` on every push to `main`.

1. Open [shop-desktop Releases](https://github.com/BlackForestPorsche/shop-desktop/releases)
2. Download **Black Forest Tools-Setup-…exe** (installer) or **Black Forest Tools-Portable-…exe**
3. Run it. Windows may warn about an unknown publisher — choose More info → Run anyway

Same live shop site as Manjaro. Unlock with your PIN.

To build the Windows apps yourself (on Windows, or with electron-builder):

```bash
npm install
npm run dist:win
```

Outputs land in `dist/`.

## AppImage (Linux)

`npm run dist` builds a Linux AppImage with electron-builder. On Manjaro, an AppImage needs `fuse2`:

```bash
sudo pacman -S fuse2
```

The Manjaro source install above is the straightforward Linux setup.
